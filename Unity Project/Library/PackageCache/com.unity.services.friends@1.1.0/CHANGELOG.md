## [0.2.0-preview.9] - 2023-03-13

### Added
- Added AddFriendByNameAsync allowing the addition of a friend using their name provided it comes from the player names service
- Added validation to make sure the service can only be used once the user is signed in.
- Added validation to make sure the service must be initialized <code>await FriendsService.Instance.InitializeAsync();</code> before it is used. Note that <code>InitializeAsync()</code> should only be called once after signing in.

### Changed
- Changed name of ManagedRelationshipsService to FriendsService in order to maintain consistency with the product's name.
- Changed the way the interaction with the service is handled. It now uses the singleton pattern to adhere to Unity SDK standards.

Before:

<code>
var service = await ManagedRelationshipService.CreateManagedRelationshipServiceAsync();

await service.AddFriendAsync(memberId);
</code>

After:

<code>await FriendsService.Instance.InitializeAsync();

await FriendsService.Instance.AddFriendAsync(memberId);
</code>

- Updated the way data is accessed from events to mostly use properties instead of functions.
- Updated properties returned by the FriendsService to IReadOnlyList.
