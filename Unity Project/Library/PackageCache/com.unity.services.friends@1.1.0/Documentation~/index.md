# Unity Friends

The Friends service allows you to boost player engagement by providing players with a social system that works well with other Unity services. 

Please consult the documentation here: https://docs.unity.com/friends

You can also go to the [Friends Dashboard](https://dashboard.unity3d.com/friends) to learn more, find documentation, and get support.

## SDK

The SDK is documented using XML comments. These will work with most IDEs to provide IntelliSense and inline documentation.

## Sample

Friends has a sample to help you get started out of the box. Make sure you've followed the **Get Started** instructions on the [Friends Dashboard](https://dashboard.unity3d.com/friends).

You can find the sample in the [asset store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/game-toolkits/friends-247503)
